Android Breakout v1.0.2
=======================

## This is a fork

This is a fork of [fadden/android-breakout](https://github.com/fadden/android-breakout) v1.0.2 imported as Android Studio project with [Android Breakout game recorder patch](https://bigflake.com/mediacodec/#BreakoutPatch) applied.

## Overview

(This was previously hosted on [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/android-breakout/).)

This is an Android implementation of the classic brick-breaking game.
This is intended primarily as sample code, providing an example of a
simple but complete game.

Some of what you'll find in the sources:

- Use of OpenGL ES 2.0 for a 2D game, including flat-shaded and
  texture-mapped elements.
- Smooth animation that doesn't require a fixed device refresh rate (game
  state advances according to how much time has elapsed since the
  previous draw).
- Use of GLSurfaceView, with correct handling of multiple threads.
- Interaction with the Android application framework, including game state
  save & restore on Activity pause/resume, and handling of screen rotation.
- Forwarding of touch events to the game loop.
- GL rendering of locale-specific anti-aliased text. (A rudimentary Spanish
  translation is included.)
- Sound effect generation and playback.
- Separation of core game logic from Android-specific elements.
- Configurable skill levels, saved preferences, and saved high score.
- Two-panel user interface that rearranges for landscape vs. portrait.
- Basic 2D collision detection.
- All code is in Java -- no native code in the app.

The game works well on tablets but it's hard to play on phones because
of the smaller display size.

### Additional Features ###

Some other things that could be added:

- Cloud storage for preferences and scores.
- Use of fancier GL features, like Vertex Buffer Objects, to improve
  rendering efficiency.
- Better configuration UI.  Could be more attractive, work better on
  phone-sized devices.
- Custom app icon.
